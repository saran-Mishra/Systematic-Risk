# Systematic-Risk
Utilizing traditional methods and learners to best explain the relationship between the return rate and the risk premium of portfolios.

# (1) A Simple CAPM Framework

Traditionally, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) assumes that the risk premium of a portfolio should be proportional to the amount of risk, as measured by the asset's beta (its sensitivity to market-wide risk). However, empirical evidence often shows that the risk premium observed in the real world is much larger than what would be predicted by the model. This discrepancy is known as the "equity premium puzzle" or the "risk premium puzzle".

Ovbiously there are many contributing factor: Risk Aversion, Psychological Bias, Model Limitations, and rare (black swan) events, to name a few.
